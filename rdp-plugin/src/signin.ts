 *
 * Behind an SSH host, a password moves only with the certificate remembered for its desktop (`known` at the old
 * address), which goes along and stays at the old address too (see RemoteDesktopService.desktopEdited): a desktop
 * behind a host trusts its first certificate unasked, so a password that came to the new address alone would go to

 * reached another way). The keys don't show which host a desktop entry is behind, so an edit moves the passwords at
 * that address behind every host: this way none of them reaches a machine at the new address that isn't the one it was
 * saved for (another host's, or the one a mistyped address leads to) without a question. Without a certificate, a
 * password is dropped, and that desktop asks. What isn't to be used (see withheld) doesn't move either. Each store's
 * part is done on its own: one that can't be listed (a Vault whose prompt was cancelled, a keychain that doesn't
 * answer) moves nothing, what it has at the old address goes later (see forgetLater), and what it has at the new one
 * can't be seen, so only the other store's tells what is there already. Returns the stores whose part waits (none, as
 * a rule): what they have at the old address is found there again should this window close first, where the
