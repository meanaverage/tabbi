     * stops to ask, rather than trusting it silently as a first use.) Not the permission to sign in without Network
     * Level Authentication: that was given to the server at the old address, and is asked for again. The saved password
     * is the one of the desktop's way there, `gateways.from` (see gatewayScope): a new user name, domain or account, or
     * another gateway (or none where there was one), drops it instead, since it was for the old one; a new address
     * takes it along, through the same gateway. Another desktop at the old address reached another way (a direct
     * profile next to one through a gateway) keeps its own, and what a desktop at the new address has stays its own.
     * Where a desktop at the new address is known already (a certificate is remembered for it), the password doesn't
     * move either, and the edited desktop asks: its certificate stays the one of the machine there, which then checks
     * out, and the moved password would go to that machine unasked, a desktop of another host's or profile's perhaps.
     * Behind a host, a password moves only along with the certificate remembered for its desktop, and is dropped
     * without one (see moveCredentialsFor). `direct`: a direct desktop (`rdp#<id>` keys), otherwise one behind SSH
     * hosts (`<ssh key>#<id>`): those of every host, since a desktop's `via` can name its host by an alias or a
     * profile's name that its keys don't show. Each store of passwords has its part done on its own: one that can't be
     * read now (Tabby's Vault locked and its prompt cancelled, the keychain not answering) keeps what it holds for the
     * desktop as it was unused, until it can be read while this window is open (see forgetLater). That is said, of that
     * store. After a new address the certificate stays at the old one as well as going along (below), whichever
     * passwords stayed there.
     *
     * A direct desktop (an RDP profile, `users` given) keeps a password for each user at an address (see
     * credentialKey), and other profiles can lead to the same address: its password goes as above only where it was
     * for the user it signed in as before (`users.from`, see signsInAs), and only where no other profile (the edited
     * one, `users.except`, aside) signs in with it; another user's, a profile's whose user is now another, stays for
     * the profiles that still sign in as them. Its saved account, if it has one, is the account's, whatever the edit. Nor
     * do the certificate, sharpness and "without NLA" decision leave an address another profile still leads to.
